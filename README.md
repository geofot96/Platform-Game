We have created 6 levels : 

	Selection level :
		This is the default level which gives the ability to the user to select which level he wants to play. 
		There are doors with numbers under them that point at which level leads each door. By default all levels are accessible but we highly recommend that you play all levels as they have different objects, enigmas and difficulties. 
		The levels are ordered in augmented difficulty.
	
	Level 1 :
		This is the first and easiest level. 
		The player needs to collect a red key in order for the locks to disappear and the lever becomes accessible. 
		Using the lever, the player can jump onto the mover which will lead him to the exit door.
	
	Level 2 :
		This is a slightly more complicated level with main focus to demonstrate the different objects the player might encounter. 
		Firstly, the player must destroy the wooden box that blocks his way by launching a fireball. 
		Afterwards he must jump to towards the two jumpers in order to collect the two keys that will unlock the star, while being careful not to touch the spikes. 
		Then he should turn the first lever on and using the mover go and collect the star. 
		Finally, by turning the second lever on he uses the mover again and exits from the door.

	Level 3 :
		In this level the difficulty rate is significally raised than the previous ones. 
		The level begins with the player falling towards the spikes and he has to avoid them, land on the jumper and then directly climb the mover. 
		If he collects the green key then the ground under him will disappear and he will die. 
		After climbing on the mover he has to light up the lower torch and then go on and light the second one up too. 
		The moment he does that the mover will start moving horizontally so he has to jump on it, jump again to collect the star, land on the mover and finally jump again to exit the door and proceed to the next level.

	Level 4 :
		This is the first dungeon level. In the beginning the player needs to launch two fireballs to light the two torches up and make the lock disappear. 
		Then he needs to kill the 2 frogs by launching fireballs in order for the second lock to disappear. 
		Afterwards he has to reach the lever by avoiding or killing the frogs, turn it on and jump on the mover who will transfer him over the spikes. 
		He turns the lever on, steps on the mover and moves to the right to collect the heart. 
		To open the lock only the first and the last torch should be on and the middle one off. 
		To achieve this the player can either launch a waterball or jump and blow the middle torch. 
		Finally, he has to avoid or kill all the frogs and flies to reach the frog boss which he has to kill to exit the door.

	Final level :
		As the name suggests this the last and most difficult level. 
		The player can't go down so he climbs the stairs and sees the red key. 
		He collects it but it's a trap! A mover blocks his way out and he gets attacked by an army of frogs and flies. 
		In order for the mover to go up the player has to kill the second highest fly but it's easier to just kill everything. 
		If he doesn't collect the key and move a little forward he will see a wall of locks blocking the army. 
		If he survives and escapes the "hell room", he goes down the stairs with the torches and collects the hearts. 
		The torches are just for decorative reasons. 
		Then he must use the movers to avoid the spikes, collect the heart by using the jumper and enter final room. Note that the last heart reappears often so the player can fully charge his life. 
		To enter the final room the player must activate the lever which will lift the mover and after a few seconds the exit will be blocked again. 
		The player must now kill the two bosses and the superboss by launching fireballs. 
		When this happens a wide mover will appear that will transfer him in the princesses prison. 
		Finally, he has to destroy the wooden boxes and touch the princess to win the game.
